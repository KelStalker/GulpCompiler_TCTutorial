// Every time we set up typescript, it helps to have this config file for that
// How we want to compile - just basic options here - much more on website
// being a json file, we need to follow the json format
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "outFile": "js/scripts.js"
    },
    // Include any files insider the src/ts/ folder by "**" 
    "include": [
        "src/ts/**/"
    ],
}
